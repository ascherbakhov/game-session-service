# GameSessionService 🎮⚙️

**GameSessionService** is a personal sandbox project, designed to help me keep my web development skills sharp while experimenting with an evolving mix of Python libraries, tools, and best practices. It’s not perfect—far from it! There’s a growing list of features I still want to refine (just take a look at the TODOs and Issues). But that’s the point: this is a space to play, test new approaches, and learn without worrying about production deadlines.

The codebase has been structured for extensibility, so as I tweak, update, and improve, it can gracefully adapt. It’s also a place where I’ve tried to incorporate some interesting modern technologies, many still in flux, but all part of the learning journey.

## Highlights
- **Poetry** for streamlined dependency handling.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** autodoc.
- Code style checks with **flake8**, **black**, **isort**, and **Ruff**.
- **Code coverage** tracking.
- Integration tests in isolated environments using **testcontainers** (*not the best idea, but interesting to test*).
- Automated CI with **GitHub Actions**.
- **Renovate** or **Dependabot** for automated dependency PRs.
- **Caching & Rate Limiting** (including user-level rate-limiting).
- **Celery + Redis** for async task processing.
- Basic observability & **Monitoring**.
- **API versioning** for backward compatibility.
- A dedicated **service layer** for cleaner architecture.

## Why This Project?
In essence, it’s just a simple, run-of-the-mill web service—like the hundreds routinely built in everyday development. But that’s exactly why it’s perfect as a laboratory. Here, I can experiment with the latest libraries, try out new patterns, break things, fix them, and learn continuously. Some features might be half-baked, others too ambitious, but that’s the nature of a playground. Feel free to explore, watch it evolve, and pick up any ideas you find useful!
